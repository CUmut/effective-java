	 * The constant interface pattern is a poor use of interfaces. That a class uses
	 * some constants internally is an implementation detail. Implementing a
	 * constant interface causes this implementation detail to leak into the classâ€™s
	 * exported API.
	 */
	/*
	 * In fact, it may even confuse them. Worse, it represents a commitment: if in a
	 * future release the class is modified so that it no longer needs to use the
	 * constants, it still must implement the interface to ensure binary
	 * compatibility. If a nonfinal class implements a constant interface, all of
	 * its subclasses will have their namespaces polluted by the constants in the
	 * interface.

	/*
	 * If you want to export constants, there are several reasonable choices. If the
	 * constants are strongly tied to an existing class or interface, you should add
	 * them to the class or interface. For example, all of the boxed numerical
	 * primitive classes, such as Integer and Double, export MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE
	 * constants. If the constants are best viewed as members of an enumerated type,
	 * you should export them with an enum type
