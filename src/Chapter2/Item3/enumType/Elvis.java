	 * This approach is similar to the public field approach, but it is more
	 * concise, provides the serialization machinery for free, and provides an
	 * ironclad guarantee against multiple instantiation, even in the face of
	 * sophisticated serialization or reflection attacks. This approach may feel a
	 * bit unnatural, but a single-element enum type is often the best way to
	 * implement a singleton. Note that you canâ€™t use this approach if your
	 * singleton must extend a superclass other than Enum (though you can declare an
	 * enum to implement interfaces).
